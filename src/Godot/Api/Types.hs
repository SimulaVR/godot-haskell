--   Godot loads resources in the editor or in exported games using ResourceFormatLoaders. They get queried when you call [code]load[/code], or when a resource with internal dependencies is loaded. Each file type may load as a different resource type, so multiple ResourceFormatLoader are registered in the engine.
--   		Extending this class allows you to define your own. You should give it a global class name with [code]class_name[/code] for it to be registered. You may as well implement a [ResourceFormatSaver].

Choosing one way over another depends if the format is suitable or not for the final exported game. Example: it's better to import .PNG textures as .STEX first, so they can be loaded with better efficiency on the graphics card.

If this object is not a reference, weakref still works, however, it does not have any effect on the object. Weakrefs are useful in cases where multiple classes have variables that refer to each other. Without weakrefs, using these classes could lead to memory leaks, since both references keep each other from being released. Making part of the variables a weakref can prevent this cyclic dependency, and allows the references to be released.

-- | Helper to manage UndoRedo in the editor or custom tools.

-- | Base class for all [i]scene[/i] objects.
--   Nodes are Godot's building blocks. They can be assigned as the child of another node, resulting in a tree arrangement. A given node can contain any number of nodes as children with the requirement that all siblings (direct children of a node) should have unique names.
--   		A tree of nodes is called a [i]scene[/i]. Scenes can be saved to the disk and then instanced into other scenes. This allows for very high flexibility in the architecture and data model of Godot projects.
--   		[b]Scene tree:[/b] The [SceneTree] contains the active tree of nodes. When a node is added to the scene tree, it receives the NOTIFICATION_ENTER_TREE notification and its [method _enter_tree] callback is triggered. Child nodes are always added [i]after[/i] their parent node, i.e. the [method _enter_tree] callback of a parent node will be triggered before its child's.
--   		Once all nodes have been added in the scene tree, they receive the NOTIFICATION_READY notification and their respective [method _ready] callbacks are triggered. For groups of nodes, the [method _ready] callback is called in reverse order, starting with the children and moving up to the parent nodes.
--   		This means that when adding a node to the scene tree, the following order will be used for the callbacks: [method _enter_tree] of the parent, [method _enter_tree] of the children, [method _ready] of the children and finally [method _ready] of the parent (recursively for the entire scene tree).
--   		[b]Processing:[/b] Nodes can override the "process" state, so that they receive a callback on each frame requesting them to process (do something). Normal processing (callback [method _process], toggled with [method set_process]) happens as fast as possible and is dependent on the frame rate, so the processing time [i]delta[/i] is passed as an argument. Physics processing (callback [method _physics_process], toggled with [method set_physics_process]) happens a fixed number of times per second (60 by default) and is useful for code related to the physics engine.
--   		Nodes can also process input events. When present, the [method _input] function will be called for each input that the program receives. In many cases, this can be overkill (unless used for simple projects), and the [method _unhandled_input] function might be preferred; it is called when the input event was not handled by anyone else (typically, GUI [Control] nodes), ensuring that the node only receives the events that were meant for it.
--   		To keep track of the scene hierarchy (especially when instancing scenes into other scenes), an "owner" can be set for the node with the [member owner] property. This keeps track of who instanced what. This is mostly useful when writing editors and tools, though.
--   		Finally, when a node is freed with [method Object.free] or [method queue_free], it will also free all its children.
--   		[b]Groups:[/b] Nodes can be added to as many groups as you want to be easy to manage, you could create groups like "enemies" or "collectables" for example, depending on your game. See [method add_to_group], [method is_in_group] and [method remove_from_group]. You can then retrieve all nodes in these groups, iterate them and even call methods on groups via the methods on [SceneTree].
--   		[b]Networking with nodes:[/b] After connecting to a server (or making one, see [NetworkedMultiplayerENet]) it is possible to use the built-in RPC (remote procedure call) system to communicate over the network. By calling [method rpc] with a method name, it will be called locally and in all connected peers (peers = clients and the server that accepts connections). To identify which node receives the RPC call Godot will use its [NodePath] (make sure node names are the same on all peers). Also take a look at the high-level networking tutorial and corresponding demos.

For example, as long as plane detection in ARKit is on, ARKit will identify and update the position of planes (tables, floors, etc) and create anchors for them.
--   		This node is mapped to one of the anchors through its unique id. When you receive a signal that a new anchor is available, you should add this node to your scene for that anchor. You can predefine nodes and set the id and the nodes will simply remain on 0,0,0 until a plane is recognised.
--   		Keep in mind that, as long as plane detection is enabled, the size, placing and orientation of an anchor will be updated as the detection logic learns more about the real world out there especially if only part of the surface is in view.

-- | Smoothly animates a node's properties over time.
--   Tweens are useful for animations requiring a numerical property to be interpolated over a range of values. The name *tween* comes from *in-betweening*, an animation technique where you specify *keyframes* and the computer interpolates the frames that appear between them.
--   		Here is a brief usage example that causes a 2D node to move smoothly between two positions:
--   		[codeblock]
--   		var tween = get_node("Tween")
--   		tween.interpolate_property($Node2D, "position",
--   		        Vector2(0, 0), Vector2(100, 100), 1,
--   		        Tween.TRANS_LINEAR, Tween.EASE_IN_OUT)
--   		tween.start()
--   		[/codeblock]
--   		Many methods require a property name, such as "position" above. You can find the correct property name by hovering over the property in the Inspector. You can also provide the components of a property directly by using "property:component" (eg. [code]position:x[/code]), where it would only apply to that particular component.
--   		Many of the methods accept [code]trans_type[/code] and [code]ease_type[/code]. The first accepts an [enum TransitionType] constant, and refers to the way the timing of the animation is handled (see [code]http://easings.net/[/code] for some examples). The second accepts an [enum EaseType] constant, and controls the where [code]trans_type[/code] is applied to the interpolation (in the beginning, the end, or both). If you don't know which transition and easing to pick, you can try different [enum TransitionType] constants with [code]EASE_IN_OUT[/code], and use the one that looks best.

--   		If you need to override the default physics behavior, you can write a custom force integration. See [member custom_integrator].

-- | SceneTree manages a hierarchy of nodes.
--   As one of the most important classes, the [code]SceneTree[/code] manages the hierarchy of nodes in a scene as well as scenes themselves. Nodes can be added, retrieved and removed. The whole scene tree (and thus the current scene) can be paused. Scenes can be loaded, switched and reloaded. You can also use the SceneTree to organize your nodes into groups: every node can be assigned as many groups as you want to create, e.g. a "enemy" group. You can then iterate these groups or even call methods and set properties on all the group's members at once.
